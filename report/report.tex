\abstract{
This report will study the matter of applying stochastic optimization techniques to solve optimal transport problems in the discrete and semi-discrete settings. In the discrete setting, the standard solver of the regularized OT problem is the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm which has a general computational complexity of $O(n^2)$. The problem is notoriously hard to solve, and the complexity of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm is too high for a very large scale setting. Stochastic algorithms can be used to cope with that problem and compute solutions of the regularized OT problem in linear time.}
